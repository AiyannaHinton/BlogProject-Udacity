# Personal Blog

This is an ongoing and incomplete project for Udacity's Front End Web Development Program.

The purpose was to create a fully responsive blog website using HTML and CSS. 

I struggled in this project as a perfectionist and plan to continue making changes in my work here until I have fully fleshed it out into a functioning website.
